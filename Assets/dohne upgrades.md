# Dohne Upgrades/Suggestions from Beta

## AI
In the beta, the AI was certainly in its beta form - if you could call it that. It really was underdeveloped. We have corrected this by utilizing the A* project that many of our colleagues have suggested. Enemies have been completely revamped. Now, Enemies will patrol areas. They also will lock-on to the player if the player is "in range" or the player shoots at them.

## Sound Effects
In the beta, there were no sound effects of any type. Now, we have implemented sound effects for the following: Guns - both firing and reloading; Doors - for opening; Levels -every level has a sound track; Items - Picking up items have sound effects.

## Animation
Originally, we had no animations. Enemies have been given attacking animation, moving animation, and attacking animation. All weapons now have firing animations as well.

## "taking a hit" notification
Players did not know if they were being damaged in the beta. This is a big issue, because player would just die, left and right, without noticing it. Now we have a standard 'blood splatter' effect so that when players are hurt, it is quite obvious.

## Number keys change weapons too
Several players in the beta did not understand how to change weapons, so we implemented multiple ways for users to change weapons. Firstly, 1,2,3,4,5 number keys will change weapons for their corresponding weapon slots. The mouse scroll wheel still changes weapons. We have also implemented 'Q' and 'E' to cycle through weapons by +- 1 slot, respectively.

## Increase run speed
Several players described the speed of the character as slow, so we bumped it up by a factor of 2. The player moves much more quickly now.

## Enemy Hit Notification
In the beta, if you attacked an enemy, there was no way of knowing that it happened. Now, if an enemy is hit, an animation will play.

## Ammo Labels
It  was suggested to have labels for how much ammo the player has/how much the player currently has.
We have decided to not add these labels, as no modern first person shooters have labels like that.
